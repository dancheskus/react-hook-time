TODO:

- Add full guide to Readme.md
- Create demo folder with styled page

BUGS:
- update timer time to 1ms and start timer. it goes to negative
- if time is 0 and you removing 1 second with "Start timer if was stopped" it goes to negative
- difficult Types import
  // import { TTimeUnit } from 'react-hook-time/dist/src/ReactTimer/types'
